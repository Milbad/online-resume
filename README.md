# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project #
Fifth project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree in [Udacity](https://udacity.com):
In this project I stored my resume data in four javaScript objects, each one representing a different resume section.
## How to run the game ##
Download the repository in your desktop, unzip it and open the "index.html" file in your browser to see the resume.

## Ressources ##
1.  **js/helper.js**:Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality from udacity.
2. **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library from udacity.
